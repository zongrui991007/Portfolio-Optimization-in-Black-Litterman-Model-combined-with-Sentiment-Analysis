# Portfolio-Optimization-in-Black-Litterman-Model-combined-with-Sentiment-Analysis
In this report, we’d like to explore how to build a portfolio with Black-Litterman model combined with sentiment analysis, how well it performs, and differences between Mean-Variance model and BL model optimization outcomes.
First, we use 2 different methods to select assets from 2019-01-01 to 2021-09-30. 
Then, calculate 1- month assets’ sentiment scores from a predeterminate financial website.
Next, build two models, test each model’s outcome in 1 million dollars with those assets’ scores. 
Finally, back test the portfolio and show its risk metrics and performing result from 2021-10- 01 to 2022-10-01.
